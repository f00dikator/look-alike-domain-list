This is a file that I use for Threat Hunting. 

Methodology

1) Download all the newly-registered domains from the last week from https://shreshtait.com/newly-registered-domains/nrd-1w
2) Compare the newly-registered domain against a list of the Alexa (or Cisco Umbrella, or whatever) top domains
3) If the two names are very similar, add them to the list
4) Hunt on that list or add them to a blacklist or whatever. Someone creating a domain name that is super close to a popular domain name is never good
